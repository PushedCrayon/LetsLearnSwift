This is a very loosely structured learning repo to get hands on experience with Swift and SwiftUI. I will update it fairly regularly with new "issues" that be used as learning topics or exercises to work through. Feel free to put up a PR to showcase your work for a particular issue and I would be happy to leave feedback or comments if you would like! 

If you would like more opportunities to grow your skillset, feel free to check out this awesome course by Paul Hudson: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui
